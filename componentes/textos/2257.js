        The operators of this website are not the “producers” of any depictions
        of actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct which may appear on
        this website. More specifically, the operators of this website limit
        their handling of such content, and only perform the activities of
        transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, and/or formatting of material
        that may depict sexually explicit conduct, all of which material appears
        on the website as the result of actions taken by third-party users of
        the website. All portions of the website that contain such
        user-generated material are under the control of the relevant user, for
        whom this website is provided as an online service by its operators.
        Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2257(h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), the
        operators of this website reserve the right to delete materials
        appearing on the site as the result of actions taken by the website’s
        users, which materials are deemed, in the operator’s sole discretion, to
        be indecent, obscene, defamatory, or inconsistent with the policies and
        terms of service for this website.
