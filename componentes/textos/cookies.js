        <li class="mb-3">
          We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers
          that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your
          personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .

      <p class="mb-3">How long we keep your personal data</p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we
        need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out
        in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer
        your queries about a products or service and as a result may keep
        personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may
        also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for
        example, where you have bought a membership. If we no longer need your
        data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
        that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your
        personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that
        processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your
        personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing
        communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not
        send you any marketing in future.

      <p class="mb-3">
        Advertising on our sites that is based on cookies and similar technology
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We use personalized online advertising on our sites. This allows us to
        deliver more relevant advertising to people who visit our site. It works
        by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the
        way you have interacted with our sites and apps. It then shows you
        adverts which we believe may interest you.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        When you browse our sites or use our apps, some of the cookies and
        similar technology we place on your device are advertising cookies, so
        we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then
        display advertising on your browser based on these interests.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We do not collect or use information such as your name, email address,
        postal address or phone number for personalized online advertising.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar
        technology with our advertising partners. This means that when you are
        on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing
        patterns on our site. We may also show you advertising on our site based
        on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our
        advertising partners.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us
        and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on
        your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop,
        you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying
        special offers or showing you products you were browsing. This allows
        companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making
        a purchase.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Advertising that we place on our site or on other sites
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We also use personalized online advertising to promote our own products
        and services. This means that you may see advertising for our products
        and services on our sites and when you are on other, third party
        websites, including social media platforms.

      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        In the next section, we explain in more detail how we use cookies and
        similar technology on our sites and apps for a number of purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Other organizations also collect user information on our sites through
        cookies, tags and pixels. Tags and pixels, also known as web beacons,
        are similar to cookies but are collected through embedded images.

        Cookies that are used by us are referred to as “first-party cookies” and

      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">What types of cookies do we use ?</p>
      <p class="mb-3">

      <ul class="pl-10 mt-3 mb-3 list-disc">
        <li class="mb-3">
          Essential – cookies that are essential to provide you with services
          you have requested. For example, these include the cookies that make
          it possible for you to stay logged into your account and make
          comments. If you set your browser to block these cookies, then these
          functions and services will not work for you. In particular, we won’t
          be able to save your preferences about cookies.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          Performance – cookies which measure how often you visit our sites and
          how you use them. We use this information to get a better sense of how
          our users engage with our content and to improve our sites and apps,
          so that users have a better experience. For example, we collect
          information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and
          by which types of users. We also use third-party cookies to help with
          performance. For example, the Google Analytics cookie gives us
          information such as your journey between pages and whether you have
          downloaded anything (details of how to opt out of it are below).
        </li>

          can provide you with a more personalized experience. A mix of
          first-party and third-party cookies are used.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          Advertising – cookies that are used to collect information about your
          visit to our site, the content you have viewed, the links you have
          followed and information about your browser, device and your IP
          address. We have set out more details on this below.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-3">How do we use cookies for advertising?</p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Cookies are a key part of how we deliver advertising on our sites. Among
        other uses, they allow us to show more relevant advertising to people
        who visit our site by showing you adverts that are based on your
        browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and
        apps. We can then show you adverts which we believe may interest you.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        As you browse our site, some of the cookies and similar technology we
        place on your device are for advertising, so we can understand what
        sorts of pages you read and are interested in. We can then display
        advertising on your browser based on these interests.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The advertising techniques we use do not collect information such as
        your name, email address, postal address or phone number. We sometimes
        use information such as your IP address and browser type and also
        sometimes share some limited aspects of this with third parties for
        advertising purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar
        technology with our advertising partners. This means that when you are
        on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing
        patterns on our site. We may also show you advertising on our site based
        on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our
        advertising partners.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us
        and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on
        your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites. The use of
        cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown
        advertising based on what you have looked at on our site.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Our App integrates third-party software that provides us with
        information about how the app is used and what content you have viewed
        for the purposes of online advertising and analytics, in a similar way
        to the sites. It uses cookies from some of the providers listed here,
        among others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">How to manage advertising cookies</p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        You can manage the use of cookies, including advertising cookies, and
        disable the sharing of data with partners for advertising purposes by
        using the steps set out here. In some cases you can turn off advertising
        cookies on a cookie-by-cookie basis, and we give the most common
        examples below.

      <p class="mb-3">
        You can switch some cookies off through the
